• What the operation does:
This operation posts new notices from faculty members to the “Latest Updates” section.
It ensures students receive important information, such as announcements, exam schedules, or reminders, promptly.

• Which Data Structure supports it:
Stack Data Structure.

• Why the Data Structure is suitable:
A stack follows Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) behavior, which means the most recently added notice appears at the top of the list.
This guarantees that students always see the latest announcements first, keeping information timely and relevant.

• How the user interacts with it:
Faculty members log in and submit new notices. The system pushes these updates to the top of the stack.
When students access the “Notices” page, the most recent notice is immediately visible, ensuring they are
informed about the latest developments.
