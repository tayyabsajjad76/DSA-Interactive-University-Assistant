• What the operation does:
This operation allows students to add new assignments to their dashboard, keeping track of all tasks that need to be completed.
Each assignment is queued so that students can work on them in the order they were assigned.

• Which Data Structure supports it:
Queue Data Structure.

• Why the Data Structure is suitable:
A queue operates on a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) basis, which matches the way assignments should be handled.
The first assignment added is the first one the student completes, ensuring an organized workflow.
Inserting at the back and processing from the front makes it easy to manage multiple tasks efficiently.

• How the user interacts with it:
When a student logs in and navigates to the “Assignments” section, they can add a new task. The system places
it at the end of the queue. Students then view and complete assignments sequentially, promoting structure and preventing confusion.
