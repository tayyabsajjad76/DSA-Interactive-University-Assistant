• What the operation does:
This operation allows students or administrators to add new subjects or events to the academic list,
maintaining an organized record of courses, workshops, or extracurricular activities.

• Which Data Structure supports it:
It supports Link List Data Structure.

• Why the Data Structure is suitable:
A linked list allows easy insertion of new items without the need to shift existing elements.
Each subject or event is stored as a node connected to the previous items. This structure keeps the list flexible,
making it simple to add, remove, or rearrange items as needed.

• How the user interacts with it:
When users access the “Subjects” or “Events” page, they can add new items to the list.
Each addition becomes a new node linked to the existing nodes. Students can navigate through the subjects or events
sequentially, which makes browsing smooth and intuitive while maintaining an organized academic structure.
