Project Story:-
In the magical DS University, Linked List Tayyab connects every student to their events, assignments, and notices, making sure no one misses a deadline.
 Stack Moazzam guards the Tower of Notices, keeping the newest updates at the top so students and faculty always see what’s most important first.
 Queue Waleed ensures that all assignments are submitted and processed in perfect order—first come, first served—so fairness reigns in every classroom.
  When a new event appears in the university, Linked List Tayyab quickly links it to all relevant students, ensuring everyone knows where to be and when.
 Whenever a notice arrives from management, Stack Moazzam pops it to the top of the Tower so urgent announcements are never missed.
 As students submit assignments, Queue Waleed lines them up neatly, letting teachers grade in the same order they were received.
 In the Student Hall, marks and attendance are displayed dynamically, with the DS characters working behind the scenes to keep the system organized and efficient.
Faculty members rely on their DS companions to manage courses, update grades, and track events without losing any information.
 Together, Linked List Tayyab, Stack Moazzam, and Queue Waleed make the university a perfectly organized universe where information flows smoothly and chaos is kept at bay.
 Every student, teacher, and administrator feels the magic of data structures helping them navigate their academic world effortlessly.
