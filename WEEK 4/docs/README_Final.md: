# DSA-Based Interactive University Assistant

## Project Overview
The DSA-Based Interactive University Assistant is a console-based application developed to manage university-related information in an organized and efficient way.
The project applies core Data Structures and Algorithms concepts to handle dynamic academic data such as university events, student assignment submissions, and official notices.
The system provides a simple, menu-driven interface that allows users to interact with data in real time.

This project demonstrates how fundamental data structures can be used to solve real-world academic and administrative problems while strengthening practical programming
and problem-solving skills.

## Project Category
- Academic Resource Tracker  
- Educational Software  
- Console-Based Application  
- Student Information System  

## Data Structures Used
- **Linked List**: Used for managing university events, allowing dynamic insertion and easy traversal.
- **Queue (FIFO)**: Used for tracking student assignment submissions in the order they are received.
- **Stack (LIFO)**: Used for managing university notices, ensuring the most recent notice is accessed first.

## Key Features
- Add and view university events dynamically.
- Track assignment submissions in proper submission order.
- Manage university notices with priority to the latest updates.
- Menu-driven console interface for easy user interaction.
- Efficient insertion, deletion, search, and display operations.
- Modular code structure for better readability and maintenance.

## System Modules
1. **Event Management Module (Linked List)**
   - Add new university events.
   - Display all upcoming events.

2. **Assignment Tracking Module (Queue)**
   - Submit student assignments.
   - View assignment submissions in FIFO order.

3. **Notice Management Module (Stack)**
   - Add new notices.
   - View notices with the most recent displayed first.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: C++ (C++98 / C++03 compatible)
- **IDE**: Dev C++ (Latest Stable Version)
- **Interface**: Console / Command-Line Interface

## How to Run the Project
1. Open the project folder.
2. Navigate to the `src` directory.
3. Compile the source file using a C++ compiler (e.g., Dev C++).
4. Run the compiled executable.
5. Use the menu options to add, view, search, update, or delete data.

## Limitations
- Console-based interface only (no GUI).
- Single-user operation.
- No permanent data storage; data is lost when the program exits.
- Limited to events, assignments, and notices.
- No network or database integration.

## Team Members
- **Tayyab Sajjad (SP24-BCS-046)** – Project Developer  
- **Moazam Ijaz (SP24-BCS-013)** – Documentation  
- **Muhammad Waleed (SP24-BCS-052)** – Second Developer  

## Future Enhancements
- Add file handling for persistent data storage.
- Extend system with exam schedules and student profiles.
- Improve input validation and error handling.
- Develop a graphical user interface.

## Conclusion
The DSA-Based Interactive University Assistant successfully applies fundamental data structures to manage university information in a structured and efficient manner.
  The project highlights the practical importance of linked lists, queues, and stacks while providing a simple and interactive academic management tool.
  Its modular design allows easy future expansion and improvement.
