### Tayyab Sajjad (SP24-BCS-046)
I mainly worked on developing the core logic of the project, including implementing and fixing the linked list, stack, and queue operations.
Through this project, I learned how proper data structure selection improves efficiency and clarity in problem-solving.
I also gained experience in debugging logical errors and organizing code in a modular way. If given more time, I would improve input validation
and add file handling for permanent data storage.

### Moazam Ijaz (SP24-BCS-013)
My primary responsibility was documentation and helping organize the project structure. I learned how to clearly document technical projects and
explain data structure concepts in a simple and understandable way. This project improved my understanding of how documentation supports software
development. With extra time, I would enhance the user guide and add more detailed examples for each module.

### Muhammad Waleed (SP24-BCS-052)
I worked on assisting with implementation and testing of the stack and queue modules. I learned how FIFO and LIFO structures work in real-world
scenarios through practical implementation. This project helped me improve my debugging and testing skills. If more time were available, I would
focus on optimizing the code and improving error handling.
